# Typing Speed Test App

This is a simple application that allows you to check your typing speed. It offers two levels of difficulty, both of which consist of a randomly generated sample of 20 words. The easy mode uses a text file of the most common English words, while the hard mode uses the `english_words` library. 

## Getting Started

To get started, simply run the `typing_speed_test.py` file. The app will launch and display the starting screen:

From here, you can choose your difficulty level and begin the test.

## Features

From here, you can click the "Go Back" button to return to the starting screen.

### Test Screens

Once you start the test, you will be presented with a screen that looks like this:

The text box at the bottom is where you type your response to the randomly generated text at the top. The app will keep track of your words per minute (WPM), net words per minute (NET WPM), characters per minute (CPM), and accuracy. The score board at the top of the screen will update as you type.

### Checking Spelling

If you make a mistake, the app will show the incorrect character in red and the correct character in white. The app will also add up the number of mistakes you make and show it in the "Mistakes" box. You can use the backspace key to correct your mistakes.

### End of Test

Once you have finished typing the text, the app will display your results in a message box:
